first we input the processes and resource counts n and m.
then we input the amount of each resource and store in a vector

we then input each of allocation and max matrix and strore them in vectors of vectors
then we calulate the need matrix

then we enter bankers algorithm
iterate through incomplete processes until we find one we can complete with the available resources
complete it then free its resources. 
repeat until all are complete or if can't complete any jobs system is unsafe
when complete print order completed.
